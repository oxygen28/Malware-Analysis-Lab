# Malware Analysis Lab

## Project Objective

The Malware Analysis Lab project was designed to provide hands-on experience and fundamental knowledge in malware analysis. The project involved several key steps, starting with the generation of a controlled malware sample. Subsequently, various tools were employed to conduct analysis, aimed at identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). Finally, the identified IOCs were leveraged to craft YARA rules for malware detection. By engaging in this project, a solid foundation in malware analysis was established, laying the groundwork for further exploration and expertise development in malware analysis.

### Skills Developed

Throughout the project, the following skills were acquired:
- Establishment of a secure environment conducive to malware analysis.
- Utilization of open-source tools to generate controlled malware samples.
- Execution of basic static analysis, basic dynamic analysis, and advanced static analysis techniques to uncover IOCs.
- Proficiency in crafting YARA rules tailored to detect specific malware based on identified IOCs.

### Tools Utilized

The project relied on a range of tools to facilitate the analysis process, including:

- Flare VM: A script designed to automate the installation and configuration of a Windows VM optimized for malware analysis.
- Open-source malware generators: Utilized to create controlled malware samples for analysis.
- Various malware analysis tools as outlined in the project report, ensuring comprehensive examination and identification of IOCs.
